Portafilter does one thing: it evaluates an expression and returns a value. An expression can be evaluated on different implementations
across multiple languages and will always return the same result. This makes it possible to re-use the same semantics in separate application tiers,
and that's really quite rad.

This is the JavaScript implementation of Portafilter. The standard lib is pretty bare at the moment, but it's the easiest part to build.

SO: in <12hrs I wrote & tested this implementation from scratch. I guess this shows that it's an easy-to-port language!
